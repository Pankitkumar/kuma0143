*I tried to to make a same deisgn as the example one 
*I added the images with some other way in the starting and then i decided to change the method 
*Then i putted up the array method and it worked for me 
*Then i started to style the css and 
*I was struck at many points like making th image bigger
*But at the end of the day it looks like this
*I took image from https://www.pexels.com/
